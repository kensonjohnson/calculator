This is a fully functional calculator program written in JS. 
My focus with this calculator app was to create a clean and attractive UI. 
Staying within the constraints of the color palette I chose, I created a minimalist design and hover effects that give the user useful feedback, such as changing colors when a button is highlighted or pressed.

## Highlights:
- Clean and attractive UI
- Good user feedback created via CSS.
